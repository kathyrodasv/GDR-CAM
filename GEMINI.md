# Project: GDR-CAM - Photo Capture Application

## Project Overview

GDR-CAM is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for capturing photos and embedding them with EXIF metadata. The application allows users to take pictures using their device's camera, fill out an observation form, and save the photo with the form data and GPS coordinates stored directly in the image's EXIF tags. The app is built to work completely offline.

The project is a frontend-only web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages browser APIs like `getUserMedia` for camera access and `geolocation` for location services. The core functionality of writing metadata is handled by the `piexif.js` library. A service worker (`sw.js`) provides offline capabilities by caching the application assets.

The repository also includes a Python script (`read_metadata.py`) which can be used as a utility to read and verify the EXIF data from the images created by the app.

## Building and Running

This is a static web project with no build process.

### Running the Application

1.  Serve the project directory using a simple local HTTP server. For example, using Python:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
2.  Open a web browser and navigate to the local server's address (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

The application is designed to be accessed via HTTPS to enable all features, especially the service worker and camera access on mobile devices.

### Running the Metadata Verification Script

The `read_metadata.py` script can be used to check the EXIF data of a saved photo.

1.  Make sure you have the `piexif` library installed:
    ```bash
    pip install piexif
    ```
2.  Place a photo generated by the app in the root directory (or modify the path in the script).
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python read_metadata.py
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Style**: The JavaScript code is written in a procedural style with a global `appState` object managing the application's state. DOM elements are cached in an `elements` object.
*   **Libraries**: The project uses `exif.js` for reading EXIF data (specifically for orientation correction) and `piexif.js` for writing EXIF data. No other external frameworks are used.
*   **Offline First**: The service worker (`sw.js`) is configured to cache all essential assets, making the application fully functional without an internet connection. The cache is versioned with the `CACHE_NAME` variable.
*   **Metadata**: Form data is serialized into a JSON string and stored in the `UserComment` EXIF tag. GPS coordinates are stored in the standard GPS IFD tags.
